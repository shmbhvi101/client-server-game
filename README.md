# client-server-game

## üìù Program Description

This program establishes a client-server connection using Python's socket programming. Upon connection, the program initially enters a chatroom mode where messages can be exchanged in a turn-based manner. Within this chat environment either the client or the server can initiate the ASCII-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game where they can play best of three. The game and chat messages are transmitted between the client and server until the termination command is sent by the client.
